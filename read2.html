			<h2>Game Title</h2>
			<p>Resident Evil 4 Remake is a remake of the critically acclaimed Resident Evil 4 from 2005. The story follows leon S. Kennedy searching for the presidnets missing daughter out in a rural village in spain.</p>
			<p>The game is a third person shooter that refines the great gameplay from the original and makes it even better by adding a parry with the knife so you can counter the enemy. They did remove some of the things from the original but they replaced it with new stuff. This remake does a great job rebuilding the old so more people can enjoy it.</p>
			<h2>Score 9/10</h2>
