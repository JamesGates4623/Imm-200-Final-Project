			<h2>Persona 3 FES</h2>
			<p>Persona 3 FES is an JRPG developed by Atlus that came out in 2007 in japan and 2008 everywhere else. The story follows a group of high school students that awaken to a power called persona. They start a group called the SEES group so they can use there new found power to explore a huge tower called tartarus that only appears during the dark hour. The dark hour is an extra hour every day that occurs every night at midnight.</p>
			<p>The gameplay of persona 3 FES is a turn based game where you have a party of four and you and the enemy take turn attacking each other until one of them wins. You can also buy more better weapons and armor to help you with fights. The game also has a day system where you live though the life of the character that you are playing as and you get to choose who you want to hang out with each day. The gameplay can be a little dated to some people since this is a playstation 2 game but I liked it.</p>
